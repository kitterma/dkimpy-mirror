2018-02-07 Version 0.7.0
    - Initial ed25519 implementation based on draft-ietf-dcrup-dkim-crypto
      experimental - IETF draft, design not finalized, See README for details
    - Port dkimsign.py to use argparse; now gives standard usage message and
      is more extensible
    - Add command line options to dkimsign.py to select header and body
      canonicalization algorithmns (LP: #1272724)
    - Add command line option to dkimsign.py to select signing algorithm
    - For dknewkey.py make default to include h=sha256 in the DNS record to
      exclude usage with sha1.  Can be overriden
    - Update ARC processing to current draft
    - Fix arcverify tag requirements (LP: #1710312)
    - Fix empty body canonicalization for relaxed canonicalization (LP: #1727319)
       * Thanks to Matthew Palmer for the report and the proposed fix
    - Add new test, test_implicit_k, to verify that RSA processing is still
      correct when the optional k= tag is not present in the DKIM public key
      record
    - Fix -v verbose reporting in dkimverify.py
    - Fix unbound local variable error when processing signatures with an x
      tag, but no t tag (LP: #1739637)

2017-05-30 Version 0.6.2
    - Fixed problem with header folding that caused the first line to be
      folded too long (Updated test test_add_body_length since l= tag is no
      longer at the beginning of a line)
    - Fixed python3.4 string interpolation issue
    - Fix some byte casting issues & typos
    - Add test case for verification when should headers are signed
    - Check and update references:
      * Replace RFC 4871 withRFC 6376
      * Replaace RFC 3447 with RFC 8017
      * Add mention of DCRUP working group addressing key length issues
