INTRODUCTION

dkimpy is a library that implements DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) email
signing and verification.

VERSION

This is dkimpy 0.6.1.

REQUIREMENTS

 - Python 2.x >= 2.7, or Python 3.x >= 3.5.  For use with DKIM, earlier
   python3 versions will work.  ARC tests fail with python3.4.  Recent
   versions have not been tested on python < 2.7 or python3 < 3.4, but may
   still work on python2.6 and python 3.1 - 3.3.
 - dnspython or pydns. dnspython is preferred if both are present.

INSTALLATION

To build and install dkimpy:

    python setup.py install

DOCUMENTATION

An online version of the package documentation can be found at:

https://gathman.org/pydkim/

TESTING

To run dkimpy's test suite:

    PYTHONPATH=. python dkim
or
    python test.py
or
    PYTHONPATH=. python -m unittest dkim.tests.test_suite

Alternatively, if you have testrepository installed:

    testr init
    testr run

The included ARC tests are very limited.  The primary testing method for ARC
is using the ARC test suite: https://github.com/ValiMail/arc_test_suite

As of 0.6.0, all tests except as_fields_b_512 pass for both python2.7 and
python3.5. The test suite ships with test runners for dkimpy.  After
downloading the test suite, you can run the signing and validation tests like
this:

python2.7 ./testarc.py sign runners/arcsigntest.py
python2.7 ./testarc.py validate runners/arcverifytest.py

The reason for the test failure is that the ARC specification (as of 20170120)
sets the minimum key size to 512 bits.  This is operationally inappropriate,
so dkimpy sets the default minkey=1024, the same as is used for DKIM.  This
can be overridden, but that is not recommended.

USAGE

The dkimpy library offers one module called dkim. The sign() function takes an
RFC822 formatted message, along with some signing options, and returns a
DKIM-Signature header line that can be prepended to the message. The verify()
function takes an RFC822 formatted message, and returns True or False depending
on whether the signature verifies correctly.  There is also a DKIM class which
can be used to perform these functions in a more modern way.

Two helper programs are also supplied: dkimsign.py and dkimverify.py.

dkimsign.py is a filter that reads an RFC822 message on standard input, and
writes the same message on standard output with a DKIM-Signature line
prepended. The signing options are specified on the command line:

dkimsign.py selector domain privatekeyfile [identity]

The identity is optional and defaults to "@domain".

dkimverify.py reads an RFC822 message on standard input, and returns with exit
code 0 if the signature verifies successfully. Otherwise, it returns with exit
code 1. 

As of version 0.6.0, dkimpy provides experimental support for ARC (Authenticated
Received Chain):

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dmarc-arc-protocol-01

This new functionality is marked experimental because the protocol is still
under development.  There are no guarantees about API stability or
compatibility.

In addition to arcsign.py and arcverify.py, the dkim module now provides
arc_sign and arc_verify functions as well as an ARC class.

FEEDBACK

Bug reports may be submitted to the bug tracker for the dkimpy project on
launchpad.
