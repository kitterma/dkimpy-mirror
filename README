INTRODUCTION

dkimpy is a library that implements DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) email
signing and verification.

VERSION

This is dkimpy 0.9.5.

REQUIREMENTS

Dependencies will be automatically included for normal DKIM usage.  The
extras_requires feature 'ed25519' will add the dependencies needed for signing
and verifying using the new DCRUP ed25519-sha256 algorithm.  The
extras_requires feature 'ARC' will add the extra dependencies needed for ARC.

 - Python 2.x >= 2.7, or Python 3.x >= 3.5.  Recent versions have not been
   tested on python < 2.7 or python3 < 3.5, but may still work on python2.6
   and python 3.1 - 3.3.
 - dnspython or pydns. dnspython is preferred if both are present and
   installed to satisfy the DNS module requirement if neither are installed.
 - argparse.  Standard library in python2.7 and later.
 - authres.  Needed for ARC.
 - PyNaCl.  Needed for use of ed25519 capability.

INSTALLATION

This package includes a scripts and man pages.  For those to be installed when
installing using setup.py, the following incantation is required because
setuptools developers decided not being able to do this by default is a
feature:

python3 setup.py install --single-version-externally-managed --record=/dev/null

DOCUMENTATION

An online version of the package documentation can be found at:

TESTING

To run dkimpy's test suite:

    PYTHONPATH=. python3 dkim
or
    python3 test.py
or
    PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m unittest dkim.tests.test_suite

Alternatively, if you have testrepository installed:

    testr init
    testr run

You should install all optional dependencies, e.g. by creating a virtualenv
and using:

    pip install -e '.[testing]'

The included ARC tests are very limited.  The primary testing method for ARC
is using the ARC test suite: https://github.com/ValiMail/arc_test_suite

As of 0.6.0, all tests pass for both python2.7 and python3. The test suite
 ships with test runners for dkimpy.  After downloading the test suite, you
 can run the signing and validation tests like this:

python2.7 ./testarc.py sign runners/arcsigntest.py
python2.7 ./testarc.py validate runners/arcverifytest.py

USAGE

The dkimpy library offers one module called dkim. The sign() function takes an
RFC822 formatted message, along with some signing options, and returns a
DKIM-Signature header line that can be prepended to the message. The verify()
function takes an RFC822 formatted message, and returns True or False depending
on whether the signature verifies correctly.  There is also a DKIM class which
can be used to perform these functions in a more modern way.

In version 0.9.0, the default set of header fields that are oversigned was
changed from 'from', 'subject', 'date' to 'from' to reduce fragility of
signatures.  To restore the previous behavior, you can add them back after
instantiating your DKIM class using the add_frozen function as shown in the
following example:

>>> dkim = DKIM()
>>> dkim.add_frozen((b'date',b'subject'))
>>> [text(x) for x in sorted(dkim.frozen_sign)]
['date', 'from', 'subject']

RFC8301 updated DKIM requirements in two ways:

1.  It set the minimum valid RSA key size to 1024 bits.
2.  It removed use of rsa-sha1.

As of version 0.7, the dkimpy defaults largely support these requirements.

It is possible to override the minimum key size to a lower value, but this is
strongly discouraged.  As of 2018, keys much smaller than the minimum are not
difficult to factor.

The code for rsa-sha1 signing and verification is retained, but not used for
signing by default.  Future releases will raise warnings and then errors when
verifying rsa-sha1 signatures.  There are still some significant users of
rsa-sha1 signatures, so operationally it's premature to disable verification
of rsa-sha1.

As of version 0.7, experimental signing and verifying of DKIM Ed25519
signatures is supported as described in draft-ietf-dcrup-dkim-crypto:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dcrup-dkim-crypto/

The RFC that documents ed25519 DKIM signatures, RFC 8463, has been released
and dkimpy 0.7 and later are aligned to its requirements.  As of 0.8, ed25519
need not be considered experimental.  The dkimpy implementation has
successfully interoperated with three other implementations and the technical
parameters for ed25519-sha256 are defined and stable.

Three helper programs are also supplied: dknewkey, dkimsign and
dkimverify

dknewkey is s script that produces private and public key pairs suitable
for use with DKIM.  Note that the private key file format used for ed25519 is
not standardized (there is no standard) and is unique to dkimpy.

dkimsign is a filter that reads an RFC822 message on standard input, and
writes the same message on standard output with a DKIM-Signature line
prepended. The signing options are specified on the command line:

dkimsign selector domain privatekeyfile [identity]

The identity is optional and defaults to "@domain".

dkimverify reads an RFC822 message on standard input, and returns with exit
code 0 if the signature verifies successfully. Otherwise, it returns with exit
code 1. 

As of version 0.6.0, dkimpy provides experimental support for ARC (Authenticated
Received Chain):

https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dmarc-arc-protocol-23

This new functionality is marked experimental because the protocol is still
under development.  There are no guarantees about API stability or
compatibility.  Since the draft is through IETF last call, further changes are
unlikely.

In addition to arcsign and arcverify, the dkim module now provides
arc_sign and arc_verify functions as well as an ARC class.

Both DKIM ed25519 and ARC are now considered stable (no longer experimantal).
